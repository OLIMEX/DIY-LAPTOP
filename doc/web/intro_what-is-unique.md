# What makes this laptop different?

The TERES-I laptop is a completely open source hardware and software product.
You don't even need a purchase to access the design files.
The CAD files and full source code are available at GitHub and anyone can download, modify and use them for their own needs.
It is important to notice that the CAD design tool that we used to make the hardware of TERES-I is also completely free and open source – KiCad.

The openness of the product puts incredible power and flexibility in the hands of the user.
If you want to implement new features, you are free to do so.
If you need another processor, more power, more memory, a better LCD, you have everything required to tailor this laptop according to your needs.
If you do not like the Linux distribution you have access to the sources and can generate any Linux distribution for your taste.
The Android SDK by Allwinner for the A64 chip can be used as another option for operating system.

The laptop is fully modular which means that there are number of possible ways to expand it.
We already have several ideas in mind.
One of them is to expand the laptop capabilities with an FPGA module so it can act as a digital storage oscilloscope, and a logic analyzer, turning it into a powerful portable laboratory instrument.
These FPGA expansion modules are currently work-in-progress and you can follow the development on web site at [www.olimex.com](https://www.olimex.com).

Another advantage is that all the components of the laptop are available for purchase separately, so if a part fails you can replace just the broken part.
This lowers the maintenance costs and helps reducing the electronics waste.

There are educational benefits in getting TERES-I – you can assemble it with your children and teach them about electronics or how computers work.
Children may learn about basic computing components, how things are assembled together, and are able to learn to conduct repairs in case something goes wrong.
This may spark their interest in electronics and programming.
Assembling the laptop is relatively easy and even small child should be able to do it under adult supervision.
