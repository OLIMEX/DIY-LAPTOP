# What's next?

This product is a work-in-progress.
We are currently working on a set of extension boards that can turn each TERES-I into a portable lab â€“ a digital storage oscilloscope and logic analyzer.

We are designing new main boards with newer and more powerful processors with more RAM and NAND flash (the trade-off would be a shorter battery life, of course).

Being OSHW, we expect community members to release their own ideas, software and hardware projects and designs compatible with the TERES-I.
