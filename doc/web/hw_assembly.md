# How do I assemble my TERES-I?

Prepare your workplace before starting the assembly process – make sufficient room and cover your desk with a soft textile to prevent scratching the laptop's plastic parts.
Do not rush during the assembly.
Make sure to read and follow the instructions carefully since disassembling the finished unit to fix mistakes is considerably harder than assembling it.

The assembly process begins with the **TERES-006-Keyboard**:

First attach the touchpad **TERES-023-Touch** to the keyboard's body:

[TERES-023-Touch 1](../images/TERES-I/hardware/043.jpg) [TERES-023-Touch 2](../images/TERES-I/hardware/042.jpg)

The touchpad uses double sided adhesive tape.
Remove the protective foil and place it on the top side of the keyboard body like shown in the pictures below:

[Tape install 1](../images/TERES-I/hardware/060.jpg) [Tape install 2](../images/TERES-I/hardware/061.jpg)

You must be careful about the orientation of the touchpad connector.
The exposed pins of the connector must be pointing UP.

The touchpad snaps very tight to the upper side plastic.
You should place it with on an even surface and make sure it is fully inserted.

Next, turn over the cover and place **TERES-022-Touch-Cover** and **TERES-010-Touch-Btns** on top of the touchpad:

The final result must look like these pictures:

The next step is to attach the TERES printed circuit boards to the keyboard body.
For this purpose use the **TERES-014-Screw-Set**.
Note that in this set there are 42 screws of different lengths:

* M2 x 1.5 ( 4 pcs)
* M2 x 3   ( 9 pcs)
* M2 x 4   (17 pcs)
* M2 x 5   (12 pcs)

It is a good practice to first sort all the screws since each screw has its own location and you should put the exact length screw to the exact place as mentioned.
All screws have same diameter M2 but different lengths – if you have difficulties determining the size, use a ruler.
For example, the M2 x 5 screw would have 5mm length (without the head).
Do not mix the lengths of the screws since doing so might damage the plastic parts.
Do not screw as tight as possible, since this might break the plastic.
Be gentle.

For the PCB’s the M2 x 3 screws must be used.

Now we assemble the **TERES-PCB3-Touch** PCB:

It is shown below, attached to the keyboard body.
Note that only the middle screw is used; the other two screws will later be used when fixing the bottom plastic cover:

The next PCB to attach is the **TERES-PCB2-IO**:

The PCB2 board has a microphone which has to be placed in the side pocket specially designated for it.

After the microphone is put in place, slip the board at an angle into the side openings for the SD card, USB, and audio connector, then place it down.

Then use one M2 x 3 screw to fix the board:

Please make sure that the side connectors are well aligned:

Next you put the PWR button plastic:

Then the LED pipe:

Next attach the TERES-PCB4-Btn (the power button):
