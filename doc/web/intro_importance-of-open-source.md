# Why does open-source matter so much?

Open Source gives you freedom.
You know everything about the TERES-I laptop. 

We provide the hardware design files and schematics.
The hardware design is made with open CAD tool.
Nothing is hidden.
The sources for the Linux distribution and step-by-step compilation instructions are available and easily accessible.
You have full access to both the hardware and the software parts and you are able to control every bit of your laptop.
You don't even have to purchase anything to access these resources – you can use our work (or parts of it) as a basis for own projects already.

The educational value of such a product is high.
Most complex hardware projects are closed and you can only indirectly guess how things are connected or how things are operating in general.

Open source gives guarantee for longevity.
It also gives you independence and self-sufficiency – if a problem appears you have the freedom to fix it.
You don't have to count only on the availability of the technical support.
Proprietary, closed-source products: do not come with source code; provide no access to the board's design layout; cannot easily add the functionality that you want; cannot modify what you don't like; no opportunity to repair your own product.
