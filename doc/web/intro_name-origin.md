# Where does the name come from?

Teres I was the first king of the Odrysian Kingdom.
This kingdom covered most of what is now present-day Bulgaria.
The Odrysian state was the first Thracian kingdom that acquired power in the region, by the unification of more than forty Thracian tribes under a single ruler.
This laptop was designed in the city of Plovdiv, Bulgaria, which was originally a Thracian settlement.
The golden mask of King Teres I was discovered in 2004 in the Valley of the Thracian Rulers near the city of Kazanlak.
