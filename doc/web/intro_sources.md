# Where are the sources?

TERES-I source and design files are available at [GitHub](https://github.com/OLIMEX/DIY-LAPTOP).
The **Hardware** and **Software** portions of the project reside in separate folders,  as we plan to release versions of the PCBs with other processors.
The current **Hardware** files are in the **A64** folder.
More is to come in the future.
The **Software** folder contains the scripts for building the official Linux image.
Scripts for Android would be added when available.
