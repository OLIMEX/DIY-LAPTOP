## Hardware

Open-source hardware delivers transparency and freedom to the user (you) as you are able to tailor the PCBs according to your needs.
You are able to add more processors, memories, etc.
All of the hardware schematics and board files are designed using [KiCad](http://kicad-pcb.org) FOSS software.

> KiCad is free software. KiCad is made available under the GNU General Public License(GPL) version 3 or greater.

All KiCad design files are available in this repository.

Different main board configurations: the first iterration comes with ARM64 and x86 and later MIPS architecture.
Other architectures may follow.
The concept is to make templates which others may use to customize so other SOCs can be used for a main board.
TERES-I comes with 1376x768 LCD configuration. Future main boards aim at 1920x1080 pixels.

TERES-I is environmentally friendly.
The main board may be upgraded without major revisions to the design, vastly reducing waste and time when new faster and better processors become available.
Spare parts are also available for purchase.
